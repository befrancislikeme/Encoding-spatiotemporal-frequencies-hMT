 % Make the figures 

% **SCRIPTX IMPORTANT NOTES**   
% 1) SCRIPTX takes a little while to run (about X hour/minutes in the RIBS system). 
% 2) SCRIPTX saves ~X GB of simulated data. 
% 3) SCRIPTX is required for all following scripts. 

example1.m  
example2.m  

% **SCRIPTY IMPORTANT NOTES**   
% 1) SCRIPTY takes a long time to run (~Y hours in the RIBS system), and does this.
